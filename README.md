# Chess Engine

An in-progress chess engine project with complete rule implementation and bitboard-based architecture.

This project implements a fully functional chess game with all standard chess rules. 

The engine uses bitboard techniques for efficient board representation and move generation.

## Testing

**Perft Tests**: Performance tests to verify move generation correctness
